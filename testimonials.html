                    <p class="mbr-text testimonial-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">When I arrived at SV there was a field of excitement that filled me in the year. The program gave me the opportunity to seek the adventure and passion for a sport that has the world as a possible office and any beach as a desk to carry on teaching and learning about the passion of scuba diving.<br><br>Throughout the year there was a lot of learning going on and not just in the field of scuba but also you learn a lot more about yourself and where you can and want to stand in this world.<br>The environment in which this is all conduct is a free place to learn and make the small mistakes and the management staff are always willing to help grow your education more. This program has given me a chance to end my internship of on a paradise island Zanzibar i a dive centre that launches every day and has endless amount of learning may it be DSD's in the pool or an Open Water Course in the ocean.<br><br>I have learned a lot on the way diving works on the business side and all the way to diving every day side of diving. I have made friends for a life time and a passion that will never die.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text testimonial-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Scubaversity made the journey amazing and when I think back on the experience, I would never change it. Under the guidance and tutelage of Colwin and his talented team I have received the best possible qualification and training. It's up to me to use the tools, tips and guidance I have gained through the journey. <br><br>The SV team take the really safe PADI standards and provide grounding to the candidates which prepares them as well and better than candidates worldwide. Our German examiner commented at the IE that the quality of the 16 SV candidates was superb.<br><br>If you're looking for change, a personal development challenge, an opportunity for self-development or simply want to be a better diver I suggest you take the plunge with the SV team. I did and it gave me tools to be an excellent instructor and a better businessman and leader than I was when I started.<br></p>
